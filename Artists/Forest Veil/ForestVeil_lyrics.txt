ECHOES

I have my father's eyes
I wear my mother's mask
No, I'm not satisfied
so don't even ask
There are so many questions
and never just one answer
In the forest of disguises
I'm drawn 
to the echoes
I'm gone
once I let go

Turn on the television
Yes, teacher I learned my lesson
but you forgot to mention
we were born into deception
So turn on the revolution
turn off the turn pike home
Turn off the noise pollution
Embrace this flesh and tone

Drawn to the mystery
You always had a hold on me
Drawn to the mystery
you always had a hold on me
the echoes
the echoes

I have my sister's hands
the one you never had
I have my brother's plans
the ones to persevere
So take off all the covers
Yes, lover I've been discovered
but you forgot to tell me
I am my own sanctuary
I'll marry the martyr's cross 
I carry
to the echoes
to the echoes

To find a place where all the voices cease
To find a trace of simplicity
To find a place where all the voices cease
to find a trace
the echoes
the echoes
the echoes 

===========================================

SCRATCH THE SURFACE

I see through smoke and mirrors
In the shadows you are fearless
I see through smoke and mirrors
In the rearview you're so nearly there

Endless chatter without much purpose
It doesn't matter, It doesn't matter
Keeps me blinded, you make me nervous
At a distance scratch the surface

In shallow water 
We're going under
the only daughter
Stoic warrior
In shallow water
We're going under
Tame the madness
Scratch the surface
Scratch the surface
Scratch the surface

I see through smoke and mirrors
In the meadow you are clearer
I see through smoke and mirrors
In the rearview you're so nearly there

This proof of burden behind the curtain
So go on searching, go on searching
Keep me savage, oh keep me open
At a distance scratch the surface

In shallow water
We're going under
the only daughter
Stoic warrior
In shallow water
keep going under
Tame the madness
Scratch the surface
Scratch the surface
Scratch the surface

I see through smoke and mirrors
In the rearview you're so nearly there

GIVER/FEAST OF BONES

I am the giver
I am the giver
I am the giver 
I am the giver

Shivers in the cold
Nestles in your bones
Careful where you go
The forest is your mind

So make a trail back home
Tucked between the folds
I take what I am owed
And leave the rest behind
Leave the rest behind
Leave the rest behind
Leave the rest behind

Sleepwalker
You are older
Sleepwalker
You are cold, cold
growing cold

As surely as the frost
Nothing will be lost
but there is still a cost
You will learn to pay

The will to flee or fight
This spark it never dies
So take it as a sign
and leave the past behind
Leave the past behind
Leave the past behind
Leave the past behind

Sleepwalker
You are older
Sleepwalker
You are cold, cold
growing cold

There's a castle in the lake
Beneath the murky breaks
Where your sins have all been paid already
And the earth never shakes
the same way twice

There's a castle in the lake
a calm before the fade
Where your wounds are on display
Take a look now
Here we never die
Here we never die
Here we never die

And you wanted more
You wanted more
You wanted more
than you could ever give
You wanted more
You wanted more
You wanted more
than you could ever give me
You could never give
You could ever give me
You could never give

So we'll dance among the ash
and cry behind the mask
Set fire to the brushes
Set fire to the past
Here we never die
Here we never die
Here we never die

And you wanted more
You wanted more
You wanted more
than you could ever give
You wanted more
You wanted more
You wanted more
than you could ever give me
You could never give
You could ever give me
You could never give

I am the giver
I am the giver
I am the giver
I am the giver

TIME ERASES

Hold the course and tense your bow
It's not what you don't know
It's not what you don't know
that's killing me

I'm never satisfied
these thorns in my mind
are keeping me inside
Haunted

Ooh's

Go for the family
With the ancient ones
In youth the shadows spawn wildly
Find your voice and don't let go
It's not like you were told
It's not like you were told
and it's killing you

Ooh's

And when the wind blows
And when my heart stops
And when the wind blows
There you go
We were never here
And when the dream ends
When I fold my holds
And when the dream ends
There you land
It was never here

Hold the course and tense your bow
It's not like you don't know
It's not like you don't know
and it's killing us
I'm never satisfied
these thorns in my hide
are keeping me alive
Hungry

And when the wind blows
And when my heart stops
And when the wind blows
There you go
We were never here
And when the dreams ends
When I fold my hands
And when the dream ends
There you land
We were never here

Hold the course and tense your bow
It's not what you don't know
that's killing me
