FRACTAL EYES

Spirits guide me
Open my eyes
Spirits find me
This ancient device

Followed a whim
Didn't think twice
Follow you in
Didn't think twice

Spirits guide me
I taste the fault line
Spirits bind me
I pay a new price

Followed you in
Didn't think twice
Follow a whim
I didn't think twice

Because we're sea foam
Make our own way
the heavy blows
to make your own way
We're sea foam
I make my own way
the heavy blows
to make your own way

Spirits guide me
Spirits find me
Spirits guide me
Spirits find me

BITTER ROOT

Swaying in the breeze
I'm affected
I can't be found out
Tender honesty
Fill the stillness
I won't be bothered anymore

Bitter Root Valley
You're underneath my gaze
I retrace those places
where you start to fade

Oooh's

So you let me down
So you let me down
it's the only way that you know how
So you let me down
So you let me down
it's the only way that you learned how

Swaying in the dream
You're affected
You can't be found now
Tender reverie
Shake the stillness
You won't be bothered anymore

Bitter Root Valley
You're underneath my skin
I erase those places
where I let you in

Oooh's

You're talking in your sleep
You're talking in your sleep
You can't shade me from all the white heat
So you let me down
So you let me down
it's the only way that you know how

GIVER/FEAST OF BONES

I am the giver (x 4)

Shivers in the cold
Nestles in your bones
Careful where you go
The forest is your mind

So make a trail back home
Tucked between the folds
I take what I am owed
And leave the rest behind
Leave the rest behind (x 3)

Sleepwalker, you are older
Sleepwalker, you are cold, cold
Growing cold

As surely as the frost
Nothing will be lost
but there is still a cost
You will learn to pay

The will to flee or fight
This spark it never dies
So take it as a sign
and leave the past behind
Leave the past behind (x 3)

Sleepwalker, you are older
Sleepwalker, you are cold, cold
Growing cold

There's a castle in the lake
Beneath the murky breaks
Where your sins have all been paid already
And the earth never shakes
the same way twice

There's a castle in the lake
a calm before the fade
Where your wounds are on display
Take a look now!
Here we never die (x 3)

And you wanted more
You wanted more
You wanted more
than you could ever give
You wanted more
You wanted more
You wanted more
than you could ever give me
You could never give
You could ever give me
You could never give

So we'll dance among the ash
and cry behind the mask
Set fire to the brushes
Set fire to the past
Here we never die (x 3)

And you wanted more
You wanted more
You wanted more
than you could ever give
You wanted more
You wanted more
You wanted more
than you could ever give me
You could never give
You could ever give me
You could never give

I am the giver (x 4)

TIME ERASES

Hold the course and tense your bow
It's not what you don't know
It's not what you don't know
that's killing me

I'm never satisfied
these thorns in my mind
are keeping me inside
Haunted

Ooh's

Go for the family
With the ancient ones
In youth the shadows spawn wildly
Find your voice and don't let go
It's not like you were told
It's not like you were told
and it's killing you

Ooh's

And when the wind blows
And when my heart stops
And when the wind blows
There you go
We were never here
And when the dream ends
When I fold my holds
And when the dream ends
There you land
It was never here

Hold the course and tense your bow
It's not like you don't know
It's not like you don't know
and it's killing us
I'm never satisfied
these thorns in my hide
are keeping me alive
Hungry

And when the wind blows
And when my heart stops
And when the wind blows
There you go
We were never here
And when the dreams ends
When I fold my hands
And when the dream ends
There you land
We were never here

Hold the course and tense your bow
It's not what you don't know
that's killing me

===============================================

TRAINS

I etched my name on the side of a train
wandered in the desert by the day
and when I awoke I wasn't afraid
and nothing but the fear has changed you

You're a strange fool
Such a strange fool
We're such strange fools

I've been here before
on the edge of your shore
Begging for a crumb
you've got me asking for more
There's a little girl frozen
left among the city
sketching her memories
No one will bother me here

I'm a strange fool
Such a strange fool
We're such strange fools

I etched my name on the side of your face
withers with the wind but it can't be replaced
and when I awoke I wasn't afraid
and nothing but the fear has changed you

You're a strange fool
Such a strange fool
We're such strange fools

================================================

ECHOES

I have my father's eyes
I wear my mother's mask
No, I'm not satisfied
so don't even ask
There are so many questions
and never just one answer
In the forest of disguises
I'm drawn 
to the echoes
I'm gone
once I let go

Turn on the television
Yes, teacher I learned my lesson
but you forgot to mention
we were born into deception
So turn on the revolution
turn off the turn pike home
Turn off the noise pollution
Embrace this flesh and tone

Drawn to the mystery
You always had a hold on me
Drawn to the mystery
you always had a hold on me
the echoes
the echoes

I have my sister's hands
the one you never had
I have my brother's plans
the ones to persevere
So take off all the covers
Yes, lover I've been discovered
but you forgot to tell me
I am my own sanctuary
I'll marry the martyr's cross 
I carry
to the echoes
to the echoes

To find a place where all the voices cease
To find a trace of simplicity
To find a place where all the voices cease
to find a trace
the echoes
the echoes

================================================

HAREM

There are some rooms I don't go in
There are some games I don't care to win
And I've got my bearings babe
While you've go the spins
There are some rooms I don't go in

There are some ties I don't need to bind
There are some lies I don't want to find
And there's that future
Well I don't need to know
Before I had you babe
I learned to let you go

There are some names I don't want to say
There are some gates I built to keep you away
And there's that past behind me
I don't want to claim
And there's a wildness in you
that can't be tamed

There are some rooms I don't go in

==================================================

SCRATCH THE SURFACE

I see through smoke and mirrors
In the shadows you are fearless
I see through smoke and mirrors
In the rearview you're so nearly there

Endless chatter without much purpose
It doesn't matter, It doesn't matter
Keeps me blinded, you make me nervous
At a distance scratch the surface

In shallow water 
We're going under
the only daughter
Stoic warrior
In shallow water
We're going under
Tame the madness
Scratch the surface (x 3)

I see through smoke and mirrors
In the meadow you are clearer
I see through smoke and mirrors
In the rearview you're so nearly there

This proof of burden behind the curtain
So go on searching, go on searching
Keep me savage, oh keep me open
At a distance scratch the surface

In shallow water
We're going under
the only daughter
Stoic warrior
In shallow water
keep going under
Tame the madness
Scratch the surface (x 3)

I see through smoke and mirrors
In the rearview you're so nearly there

=================================================

SUNRISE / SUNSET

Sunrise Sunset 
Do you have your regrets?
Backwards forwards I want more
Another worry other's stories
Backwards forwards I want more

Push when you pull 
Oh you stand when I fall
Laugh when I cry
I can't have it all
But it's over now
Know I'll confess
Life is so strange
One perfect mess

Sunrise Sunset 
Blink an eye soon forget
Backwards forwards I want more
Up and down and outside in
You fail or succeed
Can't quite win

Push when you pull 
Oh you stand when I fall
Life is so strange
I can't have it all
But it's over now
Know I'll confess
Life is so strange
One perfect mess

Sunrise Sunset (x 4)
