MEMORY OF A GOLDFISH

I have just grown up to be a small goldfish with the memory of a stone
I have just grown up to be a stone with the memory of a dust pile
I have just grown up to be dust with the memory of the stars
I have just grown up to be those stars with the memory of you
I have just grown up to be you with the memory of me
And I have just grown up to be me with the memory of you
