JETPACK

Jump in the golden waves
Do you remember the sky?
It stole our breath away

Back in the olden days
We used to pass the time
Planning a great escape

So grab your jetpack and blast
We don't even need no gasoline
We're solar run machines
Step out on the scene
Gotta drop top honey and we're headed overseas
Take it as it comes
Just rolling with the flow
All the different faces and the places that we
go-oooooooo
Wouldn't you like to know?

===========================================

ON THE ROAD

On the road to salvation
Your mama wrote a message in the sand:
All my children, please believe me, 
I just gotta move on

All alone, in desperation
Your daddy rode headfirst into the storm
and he cried and he cried

To anyone, not anyone, 
anyone, not anyone, 
does anyone know anyone at all

Behold, everything's in motion, 
there's still one hell of a tale
untold, we crawled out of the ocean, 
up from the belly of a whale

On the road, we drive for miles
nodding our heads in syncopated time
Burning like dinosaurs in the summer sun
You and I, side by side, in aluminum
in aluminum

Through the glass, 
we pass the time
Wondering what life's like, 
though other people's eyes
Burning like dinosaurs in the summer sun
You and I, side by side, in aluminum
in aluminum

===========================================

GALAXY

Takin a step, my shoes untied
Just accept, keep up my stride
At first glance you catch my eye
By circumstance, we collide
On the dance floor, I like the way you work it
visions gone blurry make my brain short circuit
hypnotized, swaying side to side
Paralyzed by the thought of paradise

Baby, why don’t you come home with me
Maybe, we’ll cross the whole galaxy

Deep space mission, we on a collision course
Boombox powered by nuclear fission. Force
fields surround us,
oops, I think they found us
interstellar vagabonds, their coming to round us
up
Sounds like trouble, fill my cup
Lets head to hubble,
yup
orbital speeds come on girl, I’ll race you
catch a glimpse of whats underneath that space suit
I got skin, and I got feelings
I got a pair of grav boots that stick me to the ceiling
So lets dance and grind,
show you a fancy time
out in the stardust tracing patters
I’ll take you down to the rings of saturn

Baby, why don’t you come home with me
Maybe, we’ll cross the whole galaxy

3-2-1, in my rocket
keep that number in your pocket
past sun we’ll be rocking
i’ll be ready when you come knocking
turn the key, spark the ignition
you and baby on a deep space mission
bend gravity past definition
out amongst the stars in that magical position

Baby, why don’t you come home with me
Maybe, we’ll cross the whole galaxy

Baby, why don’t you come home with me
Maybe, we’ll cross the whole galaxy

===========================================

COME BACK

the tension’s getting too cruel
Gotta get it out, gotta get it out
now I’m waiting to make me move
Gotta get it out, gotta get it out
No it doesn’t help you look so good
Gotta get it out, gotta get it out
Now I’m fighting to keep my cool
Gotta get it out, gotta get it out

Come back

Climbing up, with every step, one by one
headed out of the sea
No one know why we started it, like salmon
headed further up stream
Close your eyes all around you pandemonium
drifting into a dream

Come back

===========================================

ANGEL HAIR

If your on a sandcrawler, you best get off it
Tell your future for a dollar, that's what I call prophet
If your pipes start to leak, just call a plumber
Like a calendar, your days are numbered
Man I got a headache, an insane throb
Worked in an office all day, that's an inside job
If I die during sex, im gonna die hard
Take a bit out this fresh apple pie chart

If I could shoot across the sky
Slice through the air, like a phoenix on the rise
Reaching past the horizon
Day turns to night, in the great beyond

I ain't gonna heed your every beck and call
Tearing down the street, I'm a wrecking ball
If I sound uncouth, you better check it yall
Come and meet me on the roof for the second call
Cuz if I made a new town there wouldn't be no cars
We'de be riding around on top of dinosaurs
If I could pull the moon down, I'd let it dangle there
Piling pasta on my head yup that's that angel hair

If I could grind these skin and bones
Peel away the skin, with my microphone
Baking that bread, to digest whole
I don't need no body, cuz I got soul

===========================================

SALT IN THE SEA

Tonight, your the salt in the sea
Oh how you stick to me 
tonight, want to brush myself clean
wish I could break free

Sink to the ocean’s floor
wouldn’t see me anymore
Sink to the ocean’s depths
never ever lose my breath
never ever lose my…

Tonight, your the burn on my skin
wish we didn’t begin
tonight, try to make us forgotten
but you keep stinging again and again

Sink to the ocean’s floor
wouldn’t see me anymore
Sink to the ocean’s depths
never ever lose my breath
never ever lose my…

Tonight, your the tears in my eyes
think its time to say goodbye
Tonight, try to hide in disguise
been crying so much I been baptized

Sink to the ocean’s floor
wouldn’t see me anymore
Sink to the ocean’s depths
never ever lose my breath
never ever lose my…

Tonight, your the sand in my hair
want to shake you everywhere
Tonight, try to jump through the air
but you remain fastened there

Sink to the ocean’s floor
wouldn’t see me anymore
Sink to the ocean’s depths
never ever lose my breath
never ever lose my…

===========================================

LOST MY MONEY

Lost my money, it ain't coming back
Take off running, I'm joining the pack

Follow me, as I roll
I don’t care, where I go
No direction's what I need
Got no compass, just the breeze

Lost my honey, she ain't coming back
Tears stop running, under the tracks

Follow me, as I roll
I don’t care where I go
No direction's what I need
Got no compass, just the breeze

Head back like an animal,
When you hear the sound,
Better hit the ground running.
Break free from reality,
Deep inside a dream
The melody starts coming

How many letters in seven?
Yellow levers in heaven 
travel for revenue, 
gavels ain't telling it true, 
someone yelling at you
Summon the truth, 
something to prove 
and move that boulder up hill
my shoulder is killing me soft,
like Laura Croft in the apocalypse,
f**king acropolis 
Top of the hits, off the charts,
My esophagus is stopping your heart
Propping it up and dropping the parts
Medieval trees, 
reeking of evil reasons to please
teasing the bees you'll get stung
For treason you'll get hung,
strung up and run around,
jump in an underground moat.
I don't care what the vote say, nope
I ain't scared of some hopeless joke
A cloak and dagger attack--
Stoke the fire and stagger back!
Rat traps and fat stacks of napkins
The crack of dawn's happening in China
Where they're lacking vaginas
and practicing Midas touch, maybe 
the time is much crazier,
now that Russia's trading in 
candy crush ladies
my baby blush has faded today
From the cradle to the grave we'll be paving the way

Ain’t it funny, don’t deny
Got that feeling deep inside
you been wanting more, out this life
well don’t forget to enjoy the ride
what makes you come alive
what makes you come alive
candlelight, or fireside, 
what you want, don’t act surprised
all you got, you got to try
if you don’t the years go by

===========================================

I'VE BEEN RUNNING

I've been running, been running so long
My feet are tired, and I can't go on
On a winding path through the sand,
Making our way out this desolate land
Overhead, the stars overhead,
Light up the way to the horizon
All the secrets buried beneath
Laughing it up, for eternity

Suddenly the sky splits in two,
half of it black, and half of it blue
So we dig, deep in a dune
Sand falls away, revealing a tomb
Of a king with a face of gold
Carved into stone, his story is told
Here they buried, buried his ghost
With the possessions that he loved the most

Setting sail on an ocean of shade
Alone on a journey, over the waves
Will he reach to other side?
Forgetting the life that he left behind

And you know,
We're moving forward, 
backward is not how we roll
Long ago
The world started turning, 
and somehow it stays in control
Here we go
Cause a commotion, 
the tides of the ocean must flow
The tides of the ocean must flow

Taking time
What you'll find
In your mind
Cant be found
underground,
its in the sound
Of your breath,
inside your chest,
unlike the rest.

I've been running, been running so long
My feet are tired, and I can't go on
On a winding path through the sand,
Making our way out this desolate land
Overhead, the stars overhead,
Light up the way to the horizon
All the secrets buried beneath
Laughing it up, for eternity

===========================================

GRAVITY

We got a secret and we shouldn't blow it
Wondering who will be the first to show it
You might be far away
But you'll be drawn back here before you know it

Just want to make a big sound,
that's why we're shouting at the tops of our lungs
Something's holding us down,
but it also keeps us spinning 'round the sun
Got two feet on the ground,
but my heads way, way up in the clouds
I'd love to rule this town,
instead I'll say your name out loud

When you come home we can go out together
Wearing nothing but pink plastic leather
We'll howl at the moon,
Dancing dripping in this sticky weather

Just want to make a big sound,
that's why we're shouting at the tops of our lungs
Something's holding us down,
but it also keeps us spinning 'round the sun
Got two feet on the ground,
but my heads way, way up in the clouds
I'd love to rule this town,
instead I'll say your name out loud
