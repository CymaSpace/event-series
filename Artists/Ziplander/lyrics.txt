 Grandpa 


Grandpa was a night patrolman
A night patrolman in his 
Early days
 
Moved them all from Alabama
Alabama
The old home place
 
Went clear up to Eastern Washington
Eastern Washington
The desert plain
 
All he knew he was helping the war
Helping the war
Like a young man should


He didn’t know they were building the bomb
He didn’t know what was going on


Then one day he found religion
A Preacher man would he
Become
 
Moved them back to Tuscaloosa
To Tuscaloosa where they’d
Remain


2 years later they dropped the bomb
2 years later they acted wrong
2 years later the devil’s song
2 years later … they dropped the bomb

Seven decades go by I went up that river
The Columbia River
To fish and play
 
Now I find myself on that river
The Columbia River is where I stay
 
That old site is radioactive
Radioactive scientists say
 
Secrets abound from the government
From the government 
Of the USA
 

He didn’t know they were building the bomb
He didn’t know what was going on 
I don’t know how far it’s come
I don’t know the damage done
 

Grandpa climbed up Rattlesnake Mountain
Rattlesnake Mountain 
Then he slid back down

He planted a tree in Dismal Canyon
Dismal Canyon 
Where the big trees grow

He sang the sermon at Pinetucky Baptist
Pinetucky Baptist 
Is where he laid his hands

He played the harmonica with me on his knee
Me on his knee 
Until I cried for more

CAMPO

Gotta get out of Campo
Border patrol’s on his trail
Ask anyone he’s an honest man
Can’t escape this howling wind

Running from a life of boredom
Running from a life of fear
Running from the barriers
Created by the hands of man

Rattlesnakes abound in the desert
Water is nowhere in sight
Haven’t seen a cloud
In 47 days by now

Miguel sits under a Joshua tree
Thinking how things used to be
And what in the world
Was he doing here

Traded in a shiny car
For some shoes that’ll travel far
Might even reach the Northern Star 

Left behind a life on the ranch
So he could live at the seat of his pants
He’s gonna pray to all the saints that he knew 

Agent Duffy works for the US Patrol
Drinks his whiskey straight
It’s black label 
Outta brown paper bag

He bears a cross to his father
To keep his country white
He flashes some pride
That he wears on his shoulder

Miguel hops on a passing train
He is gonna stake his claim
Up the Eastern Sierra
Is where the gold lies

He meets a hobo named Barnaby
From his native land did he flee
He’s gonna cultivate the land
For Mary Jane

Setting out from the Salton Sea
Didn’t know how this life would be
Damn it feels good to be free

Danger zone has come and gone
Memories flood of their home
And the idea of returning has surely flown

With a hundred miles from Tahoe
There is something they should know
That Agent Duffy 
Has boarded the train

Can I see your papers son
He said as he glanced at his gun
I’ve been looking for you boys
For a while now

From Mojave to Cajon Pass
Those steps were your last
You’re gonna have to come now
Here with me

But just then that engine choked
With it’s many pistons stroked
And it caused Agent Duffy
To fall to his knees

Holy man did they bolt
Right around that blue coat
And they jumped right outta that moving train

Couple scrapes but they stood up
Wild eyed with fist pump
And they never saw Agent Duffy again

Miguel and Barnaby
Agent Duffy and you and me
We’re all running from a life of boredom and fear

Run from a life of boredom 
Run from a life of fear
Run from the barriers 
Created by the hands of man
