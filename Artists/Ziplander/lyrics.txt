Grandpa 

Grandpa was a night patrolman
A night patrolman in his 
Early days
 
Moved them all from Alabama
Alabama
The old home place
 
Went clear up to Eastern Washington
Eastern Washington
The desert plain
 
All he knew he was helping the war
Helping the war
Like a young man should


He didn’t know they were building the bomb
He didn’t know what was going on


Then one day he found religion
A Preacher man would he
Become
 
Moved them back to Tuscaloosa
To Tuscaloosa where they’d
Remain


2 years later they dropped the bomb
2 years later they acted wrong
2 years later the devil’s song
2 years later … they dropped the bomb

Seven decades go by I went up that river
The Columbia River
To fish and play
 
Now I find myself on that river
The Columbia River is where I stay
 
That old site is radioactive
Radioactive scientists say
 
Secrets abound from the government
From the government 
Of the USA
 

He didn’t know they were building the bomb
He didn’t know what was going on 
I don’t know how far it’s come
I don’t know the damage done
 

Grandpa climbed up Rattlesnake Mountain
Rattlesnake Mountain 
Then he slid back down

He planted a tree in Dismal Canyon
Dismal Canyon 
Where the big trees grow

He sang the sermon at Pinetucky Baptist
Pinetucky Baptist 
Is where he laid his hands

He played the harmonica with me on his knee
Me on his knee 
Until I cried for more

CAMPO

Gotta get out of Campo
Border patrol’s on his trail
Ask anyone he’s an honest man
Can’t escape this howling wind

Running from a life of boredom
Running from a life of fear
Running from the barriers
Created by the hands of man

Rattlesnakes abound in the desert
Water is nowhere in sight
Haven’t seen a cloud
In 47 days by now

Miguel sits under a Joshua tree
Thinking how things used to be
And what in the world
Was he doing here

Traded in a shiny car
For some shoes that’ll travel far
Might even reach the Northern Star 

Left behind a life on the ranch
So he could live at the seat of his pants
He’s gonna pray to all the saints that he knew 

Agent Duffy works for the US Patrol
Drinks his whiskey straight
It’s black label 
Outta brown paper bag

He bears a cross to his father
To keep his country white
He flashes some pride
That he wears on his shoulder

Miguel hops on a passing train
He is gonna stake his claim
Up the Eastern Sierra
Is where the gold lies

He meets a hobo named Barnaby
From his native land did he flee
He’s gonna cultivate the land
For Mary Jane

Setting out from the Salton Sea
Didn’t know how this life would be
Damn it feels good to be free

Danger zone has come and gone
Memories flood of their home
And the idea of returning has surely flown

With a hundred miles from Tahoe
There is something they should know
That Agent Duffy 
Has boarded the train

Can I see your papers son
He said as he glanced at his gun
I’ve been looking for you boys
For a while now

From Mojave to Cajon Pass
Those steps were your last
You’re gonna have to come now
Here with me

But just then that engine choked
With it’s many pistons stroked
And it caused Agent Duffy
To fall to his knees

Holy man did they bolt
Right around that blue coat
And they jumped right outta that moving train

Couple scrapes but they stood up
Wild eyed with fist pump
And they never saw Agent Duffy again

Miguel and Barnaby
Agent Duffy and you and me
We’re all running from a life of boredom and fear

Run from a life of boredom 
Run from a life of fear
Run from the barriers 
Created by the hands of man

Tincture in Time

Tincture in Time
Mix it with wine
Bubble it up in my head.
Feeling the glow,
there’s something you should know…
forgive me if it bleeds into red

I bask in the sun
coming undone
reaching that golden spot
Loosen the grip
I ain’t wastin’ no trip
wishin I was somewhere I’m not

Nobody knows
why the shape of those toes
are scooped like a backyard shovel
They’ve been there since birth
just a distal girth
Why do they look so befuddled?

I bask in the sun
coming undone
reaching that golden spot
Loosen the grip
I ain’t wastin’ no trip
wishin I was somewhere I’m not

The time in between
coffee and dreams
pixellated staccato
Now I’m just fine 
with some tincture in time
Excuse me, while I pour another.

I bask in the sun
coming undone
reaching that golden spot
Loosen the grip
I ain’t wastin’ no trip
wishin I was somewhere I’m not


===============================
Moon and Stars

I think the moon and stars of you
I think the moon and stars my dear

I've been out all night long with you
The hazy chain of the milky way
Said all I have to say

I wish you would share a little bit
Of the trials you’ve been going through

So stay awake a little longer
The grandeur of illumination
Set your spirit in motion


We look through that telescope
For any little sign of hope

Your mercury is rising
But Orions belt is tied up tight
Follow eternal light

The northern lights majesty
Travel far inside your heart

Your mountains tell your mysteries
Don’t let your clouds cover up
Let the spirits fill your cup

OH-O-OH

I think the moon and stars of you
I think the moon and stars my dear

So why don’t you appear
Why don’t you appear
Why don’t you appear

=====================================
In the Morning

I’m leaving in the morning (in the morning)
In the morning I will go
 
I got no expectations
Of what’s calling my name
Set out for where life takes me
For where my heart knows to go
 
But tonight lets find something to hold onto
To come back to if all goes broke
I am haunted by my demons
Gonna slay them til they’re gone
 
I’m leaving in the morning (in the morning)
In the morning I will go
I’m leaving in the morning (in the morning)
In the morning I will go
 
Going where I don’t speak the language
Where money and power are no good
Learn the ways of my animal spirit
Live the tales I’ve always known

But tonight lets find something to hold onto
To come back to if all goes broke
Gonna rise up out of the shadows
Shine that life forevermore

I’m leaving in the morning (in the morning)
In the morning I will go
I’m leaving in the morning (in the morning)
In the morning I will go
 
Clear blue waves to the horizon
Majestic mountains are full of snow
Give praise for all God's beauty
Lets cherish this land our ancestors knew
 
I’m leaving in the morning (in the morning)
In the morning I will go
I’m leaving in the morning (in the morning)
In the morning I will go

============================================
Feather River

I was having a time
On the Fourth of July
I was feeling fine 

Slide on through
The water’s blue
Got my buddies and you

We’re on the Middle Fork
Of the Feather River
A soliloquy of sound does shimmer

The fluorescent lights
All have faded
The city...so far away

A fire’s lit, time to slow down
The wandering eye turns inward

Heroes, beggars we’re on a journey
Salvation lies within the borders

Next day we follow the detour
Shedding our skin 
Is the way to begin

Get out of attacks
From the black forest
There’s brightness ahead just around the bend

We reach out our hands 
For the low hanging fruit
Tastes bittersweet without you here

We take the mountain pass
to the gathering
A kaleidoscope of folks have descended

To gain a consciousness of resonation
Light and air blissful jubilee 

We see our old bud they call Pusher
He’s got a real nice VW van
We get a 1 way ticket to the promised land
Float on down the Feather River

Float on down the Feather River
Float on down

==============================================
Simple Life

It’s alright….yeah it’s alright
 
Sometimes... we get down on our luck
And wish for the nip and tuck
Everybody is stressing you out
Hoping that coffee will break you out of that spell
 Oh that spell…Oh that spell 
 Make it swell
 
Na na na nah 

Oh that morning when the sun came up
My spirits sank into the bluff
Where had all the lessons I’d learned
Had gone into the great unknown
The great unknown…the great unknown
Won’t you make it known
 
Na na na nah 

Taken for permanent til it burns
down to the ground Were there signs?
Oh yeah all around
Directions... to a simple life
The Simple Life...Live a Simple Life...The Simple Life
